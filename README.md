# SoC-Lab
This repository contains the lab files used in the **Embedded System on a Chip** course at the American University in Cairo (AUC). The lab sessions provide the necessary information to build a small AMBA-based System on Chip (SoC), starting from the basics.

### Lab Sessions Overview

| **Lab Number** | **Title**                                           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lab 1**      | **AHB-Lite Basics**                                 | Introduction to the AMBA AHB-Lite bus protocol and basic transactions.                            |
| **Lab 2**      | **Building the TinySoC**                            | Constructing a simple SoC using AHB-Lite components.                                              |
| **Lab 3**      | **Designing a UART Transmitter**                    | Implementing a UART transmitter module and integrating it into the SoC.                           |
| **Lab 4**      | **Implementing TinySoC on an FPGA**                 | Synthesizing and deploying the SoC design onto an FPGA platform.                                  |
| **Lab 5**      | **Adding an XiP Flash Controller to TinySoC**       | Incorporating an Execute-in-Place (XiP) flash controller to enable code execution from flash.     |
| **Lab 6**      | **Developing a Simple Accelerator for TinySoC**       | Designing and integrating a custom hardware accelerator into the SoC.                             |

These labs guide you through the process of designing and implementing a SoC, covering key concepts and practical skills needed in embedded system development. By progressing through the labs, you will gain hands-on experience with hardware design, system integration, and software development for embedded systems.

**Note:** Each lab builds upon the previous ones, so it is recommended to complete them in order. Additional resources and support materials are provided within each lab to facilitate learning and project completion.
